# Tweet TextArea â€“ The "Yes, I struggled a lot" edition

This project is a humble attempt to complete a seemingly impossible assignment.  
It includes:
- React
- Vite
- JavaScript
- Zustand (Never heard of ... once i'll find out)
- localStorage (ehm...)

For now, I have no idea what i am doing and where to start

## How to run it?

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
