# Tweet TextArea â€“ The "Yes, I struggled a lot" edition

This project is a humble attempt to complete a seemingly impossible assignment.  
It includes:
- React
- Vite
- JavaScript
- Zustand (My current abstraction of Zustand is : wrap the entire React app into a class, and make a global array)
- localStorage (Maybe the local variable to each component separately, that lives accross multiple renders?)

## How to run it?

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
